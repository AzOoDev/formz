# ![FormZ](Documentation/Images/formz-icon@medium.png) FormZ - Changelog

1.0.0 - 2017-03-23
------------------

First stable version! üçª

After months of work on making the extension as reliable as possible (core refactoring, better architecture, hundreds of unit tests), the first stable version is finally out!

**Please note that major changes have been made since last beta version, you should check the breaking changes below (commits that begin with `[!!!]`).**

- **[[#48](https://github.com/romm/formz/pull/48)] [FEATURE] Handle `warning` and `notice` types in validation messages**

  This commit adds a more reliable handling of the warning and notice message types in validation rules.

  These messages wont block a validation (an error will), but can be used to deliver more information to the final user about actions done during the validation.

  Ajax requests are supported.

- **[[#49](https://github.com/romm/formz/pull/49)] [!!!][TASK] Change fields TypoScript configuration `activation` keys**

  For the fields activation configuration, the keys `items` and `condition` have been changed to `conditions` and `expression`.

  This makes more sense for what these configuration actually do.

  A depreciation message has been added to help converting old configuration to the new one.

- **[[#52](https://github.com/romm/formz/pull/52)] [!!!][TASK] Rename `section` to `slot`**

  The decision has been taken to rename the two view helpers `formz:section` and `formz:renderSection` to `formz:slot` and `formz:slot.render`.

  This helps to reduce the confusion with Extbase `f:section` and `f:render` view helpers.

  The argument `section` of the view helper `renderSlot` has also been renamed to `slot`.

  See examples below:

  Old:
  ```
  Template :
  ----------
  <formz:field name="myField" ...>
      <formz:section name="Field">
          <f:form.textField />
      </formz:section>
  </formz:field>

  Layout :
  --------
  <fieldset>
      <formz:renderSection section="Field" />
  </fieldset>
  ```

  New:
  ```
  Template :
  ----------
  <formz:field name="myField" ...>
      <formz:slot name="Field">
          <f:form.textField />
      </formz:slot>
  </formz:field>

  Layout :
  --------
  <fieldset>
      <formz:slot.render slot="Field" />
  </fieldset>
  ```

- **[[#53](https://github.com/romm/formz/pull/53)] [FEATURE] Introduce `slot.has` view helper**

  This is a conditional view helper, used to check if a slot has been defined in a field template. It allows changing the HTML rendering depending on the presence of the slot.

  **Example:**

  ```
  <div class="container">
      <formz:slot.has slot="Image">
          <div class="image">
              <formz:slot.render slot="Image" />
          </div>
      </formz:slot.has>
  </div>
  ```

  `<f:then>` and `<f:else>` work too!

  ```
  <div class="container">
      <formz:slot.has slot="Image">
          <f:then>
              <formz:slot.render slot="Image" />
          </f:then>
          <f:else>
              <img src="default-image.jpg" />
          </f:else>
      </formz:slot.has>
  </div>
  ```

- **[[#58](https://github.com/romm/formz/pull/58)] [!!!][TASK] Rename `formz` namespace to `fz`**

  The decision has been taken to rename the namespace `formz` to `fz` in the contexts below.

  The main reason is to improve readability: `fz` is far more ignorable by the eye than `formz` is. It also reduces the weight of the generated code.

  - **JavaScript**: the global namespace `Formz` is now accessible with `Fz`.

    Note that `Formz` is still accessible, but should be avoided.

    **Example:**

    ```javascript
    Fz.Form.get(...)
    ```

  - **CSS**: the entire list of data attributes that looked like `formz-*` are transformed to `fz-*`. This does affect generated CSS files.

    **Example:**

    ```css
    form[fz-value-gender="male"] {
        ...
    }
    ```

  - **Fluid**: the namespace `formz`, which was used in every template of the extension has been renamed to `fz`.

    **Example:**

    ```html
    {namespace fz=Romm\Formz\ViewHelpers}

    <fz:field name="Email">
        ...
    </fz:field>
    ```

- **[[58b0fe0](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/58b0fe09793a84eb7784fc2f401ccb11b281e45e)] [!!!][TASK] Remove method `onRequiredArgumentIsMissing`**

    This method has nothing to do with the form API, and is entirely and only bound to controller behaviours.

    If you need it, please paste the code in your own controller.

- **[[0f73599](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/0f73599dad09d536568d767b3626ef47e660e048)] [!!!][TASK] Change form TypoScript configuration `activationCondition`**

  The TypoScript configuration `activationCondition` has been renamed to `conditionList`.

  This makes more sense for what this configuration actually do.

  A depreciation message has been added to help converting old configuration to the new one.

- **[[e32f00c](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/e32f00c5a0768070a084be17156f814d51ad342c)] [!!!][TASK] Rename `feedback` to `message`**

  The old decision to use the word "feedback" for actual validation messages was a mistake that could lead to misunderstanding. Indeed, TYPO3 core uses the word "messages" everywhere for errors, warnings and notices, and never "feedback".

  It has been decided to rename it before the stable version is out.

0.4.1 - 2017-02-15
------------------

TYPO3 version requirement changed from 8.5 to 8.6 (mistake from last version).

0.4.0 - 2017-02-15
------------------

Support for TYPO3 8.6 has been added. It means you should now be able to use FormZ with TYPO3 6.2/7.6/8.6!

----

- **[[#44](https://github.com/romm/formz/pull/44)] [FEATURE] Introduce TYPO3 8.6 support (#44)**

0.3.3 - 2017-01-25
------------------

This release fixes a PHP warning (which could be thrown as an exception) when working on TYPO3 >= 7.6.13.

----

- **[[5f119e1](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/5f119e1be9b7510bd79378539ad02d7831cb0b15)] [TASK] Introduce legacy version of `FormViewHelper`**

0.3.2 - 2017-01-24
------------------

This release introduces partial backend support for FormZ, meaning you can use FormZ in any backend module.

The last remaining known issue is ajax calls, which wont work for now.

----

- **[[f2ca2b1](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/f2ca2b19177ee2eae94e3daf6eef688191392b1d)] [TASK] Add new layout for TYPO3 backend (#40)**

  **[[98f3a0f](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/98f3a0fc4d2fdce36717994a783db398a94633a5)] [TASK] Improve assets inclusion to make it work in backend context (#38)**

  **[[3cc9886](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/3cc9886b05a26d524704f91b4f97d45d3501e01a)] [TASK] Add backend support for `TypoScriptUtility` (#36)**

0.3.1 - 2017-01-05
------------------

This release fixes two issues, updating is recommended.

----

- **[[a71a039](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/a71a039ae4b56cf4f86cc428fc66e6312b1ddd52)] [BUGFIX] Delete required property for activation configuration**

  The property `items` for activations (fields and conditions) was flagged as required, that is not true and has been removed.

- **[[55769f9](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/55769f93eb6ce16d8a7544250181eea51b02874d)] [BUGFIX] Fix page renderer singleton issue**

  The page renderer must be instantiated with `GeneralUtility::makeInstance()` instead of Extbase object manager (or with an inject function).

  This is due to some TYPO3 low level behaviour which overrides the page renderer singleton instance, whenever a new request is used. The problem is that the instance is not updated on Extbase side.

  Using Extbase injection can lead to old page renderer instance being used, resulting in a leak of assets inclusion, and maybe more issues.

0.3.0 - 2016-12-10
------------------

This release fixes two minor issues, and one major issue. Please update to this new version!

The road to full unit tests coverage continues.

- **[[45020d6](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/45020d6e62ae2e30024188020b57d6dea8206d11)] [TASK] Introduce asset handler connectors**

  Big refactoring of the asset handlers usage: connectors have been introduced, in order to split the several asset handlers usage. A whole tests suite has been written for these connectors.

  A refactoring of the condition API has also been made, to help testing out some functionnality of the asset handler connectors, but also to resolve an issue that has been discovered during development (#28).

- **[[35528cf](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/35528cf7a64501fccf091a86ffd3394e8d2a32dc)] [BUGFIX] Fix the js email validator regex (@Mopolo)**

- **[[e8c9a4b](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/e8c9a4bd91261777587f6c16358a381e76b6daf4)] [BUGFIX] Fix double event issue for text inputs**

0.2.0 - 2016-11-10
------------------

This release fixes two severe issues (see below), it is **strongly recommended** to upgrade to this version.

A new condition type has also been introduced: `fieldIsEmpty`, which can be used to check whether a field has no value set.

A bunch of unit tests are also embedded in this version, making a step forward the first stable version, which will be released when the tests coverage reaches a correct rate.

----

**Major commits list:**

- **[[5849c42](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/5849c4241946e673cf0895a1d2c2440eb697a0a3)] [FEATURE] Add new condition `fieldIsEmpty`**

  Adding a new condition, with its own JavaScript connector. It is verified when a field has no value, but also when a multiple checkbox has no value checked.

- **[[3e70d83](https://github.com/romm/formz/commit/3e70d8364320a050c59699f66be6c0e8b2f9ce6f)] [BUGFIX] Fix wrong JavaScript call**

  A JavaScript debug statement was using the `Debug` library directly, instead of the low-level `debug` function.

  It could cause an error when the `Debug` library was not loaded (when the debug mode is not enabled in FormZ configuration).

- **[[#26](https://github.com/romm/formz/pull/26)] [BUGFIX] Fix persistent option in field ViewHelper**

  When using the ViewHelper `<fz:option>` inside `<fz:field>`, the option would not be deleted after the whole field is processed, resulting in unwanted options in later fields, which could cause pretty ugly behaviours.

  For instance, a field could be flagged as required even if it is not.

  In the following example, the option `required` would have been present for the field `bar` (it is now fixed by this commit).

  ```
  <fz:field name="foo">
      <fz:option name="required" value="1" />

      [...]
  </fz:field>

  <fz:field name="bar">
      [...]
  </fz:field>
  ```

0.1.1 - 2016-10-10
------------------

- **[[#1](https://github.com/romm/formz/pull/1)] [TASK] Implement Travis & Coveralls integration**

  A continuous integration is now up and running on the Git repository.

  Unit tests are being written.
